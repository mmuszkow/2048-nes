# 2048-nes
2048-game port to Nintendo Entertainment System, an example game written totally in C from the time when I was messing with NES homebrew. Requires cc65 to be built, if you just want to try the game download *2048.nes* 

* 2048.c - code of the game
* 2048.cfg - memory layout
* 2048.chr - graphics (tiles/sprites) data 
* .. rest - Shiru's low-level and music libraries
